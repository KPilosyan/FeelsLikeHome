### Overview
FeelsLikeHome is a social network for IT Specialists to help each other turn creative ideas into reality. Many professionals have innovative ideas that never come to life because they do not have the proper support or guidance. FeelsLikeHome allows the users to partner up with each other over an idea and bring it to life. There is NO MONEY
involved; this is NOT a job-searching platform - our users come together over an idea and make the idea their primary motivation. 

### Details
A user can form new communities over his/her idea. There should be a maximum of 12 members in a community to maintain open and direct communication between the members. It is crucial for all the users to feel comfortable and valued in FeelsLikeHome - as the name suggests. In the idea posting section, the user may select the visibility of the post - 'Public', 'Private' (only my partners), 'Selected' (select manually), and 'Community' (members of a particular community). Other users can search and find ideas that intrigue them, send a "Join Request" and partner up around the idea. Every user has to provide his CV or manually fill in his experience upon which the idea owner gets to select his/her partners.
