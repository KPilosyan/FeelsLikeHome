# FeelsLikeHome

Before starting, the initial idea behind FeelsLikeHome is to create a web platform where programmers from all over the world can form communities, share ideas for a unique project, work on those ideas together, and most importantly, prioritize the thrill of invention over getting paid for a project. I myself would love to be in such a community; where everything is transparent, and we all want to create something creative together, feeling like we are not alone in this buzz; we have a place that FeelsLikeHome.
